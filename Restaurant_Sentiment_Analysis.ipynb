    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* I used Restaurant Review dataset where can be downloaded from Kaggle. \n",
    "* Dataset type is tsv, so the data was seperated with 'tab'.\n",
    "* Dataset has 900 entry and 2 columns which are called 'Review' and 'Liked'.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Preprocessing the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Removed the stopwords from Review statements\n",
    "* Used Porter Stemmer for finding their root.\n",
    "* Removed any punctuation and transformed lowercase all words.\n",
    "* Transformed the words into the numeric value by usin CountVectorizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Build the Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGBoost and Neural Network was used in this project.\n",
    "* Confusion matrix and Classification Report were used to evaluate the model.\n",
    "* Neural Network was designed with one input, two hidden layer and one output layer.\n",
    "* ReLu and Sigmoid activation functions were used.\n",
    "* Adam optimizer was used and Binary Cross Entropy was used as a loss function.\n",
    "* 8 epochs and 35 batch size were used to train the dataset. (I tried with 16 epochs but this caused overfitting. So, I decrease the epochs gradually and the best epochs is 8.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluate the Models\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gaussian Naive Bayes has 0.73 accuracy, XGBoost 0.72, and Neural Network 0.78 accuracy score.\n",
    "* Also, Gaussian Naive Bayes F1 Score is 0.72, XGBoost 0.74, and Neural Network 0.82 F1 Score.\n",
    "* All in all, Neural Network is realiable model. It can be used to classify the Review Sentences."
