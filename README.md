# Restaurant-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Gaussian-Naive-Bayes--XGBoost-and-Neural-Network
## Executive Summary  #### About Data:  * I used Restaurant Review dataset where can be downloaded from Kaggle.  * Dataset type is tsv, so the data was seperated with 'tab'. * Dataset has 900 entry and 2 columns which are called 'Review' and 'Liked'.  #### Preprocessing the dataset  * Removed the stopwords from Review statements * Used Porter Stemmer for finding their root. * Removed any punctuation and transformed lowercase all words. * Transformed the words into the numeric value by usin CountVectorizer.  #### Build the Models  * Gaussian Naive Bayes, XGBoost and Neural Network was used in this project. * Confusion matrix and Classification Report were used to evaluate the model. * Neural Network was designed with one input, two hidden layer and one output layer. * ReLu and Sigmoid activation functions were used. * Adam optimizer was used and Binary Cross Entropy was used as a loss function. * 8 epochs and 35 batch size were used to train the dataset. (I tried with 16 epochs but this caused overfitting. So, I decrease the epochs gradually and the best epochs is 8.)  #### Evaluate the Models  * Gaussian Naive Bayes has 0.73 accuracy, XGBoost 0.72, and Neural Network 0.78 accuracy score. * Also, Gaussian Naive Bayes F1 Score is 0.72, XGBoost 0.74, and Neural Network 0.82 F1 Score. * All in all, Neural Network is realiable model. It can be used to classify the Review Sentences.
